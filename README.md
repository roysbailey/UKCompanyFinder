# UK Company Finder

Demonstrates the use of the gov.uk companies house beta API from a node js website.

You will need to get an API key, which must be set in an environment variable CH_BASIC_AUTH, in the following format:

	"Basic {YOUR API KEY FROM COMPANIES HOUSE}"
	Note. you dont include the '{}' characters above, but do include the quotes. 

Enjoy!
